## Description

The practical part of the NSI test for the final year baccalaureate is an assessment that takes place over a period of one hour. It consists of the resolution of two exercises on the computer, each one being marked on 4 points. The evaluation of the practical part is done through a dialogue between the candidate and a teacher-examiner.

The first exercise involves programming a specific algorithm that is explicitly part of the curriculum. This exercise does not present any particular difficulty, and a specification is provided to guide the candidate in its resolution. It is essentially a question of restoring an algorithm which has been studied several times during training. The subject can also propose a test set with the expected answers, thus allowing the candidate to check his work.

The second exercise consists of working on a program already provided to the candidate. It does not require the complete writing of a program, but assesses different programming skills in various ways. For example, the candidate may be asked to complete a partially written program following a given specification, to complete a program to document it, or to add assertions to an existing program, etc.

## Usage

Reminder : Every year, an official list of X practical exam subjects is provided. Each candidate can only be assigned one of these subjects.

The objective is to provide NSI final year students with a practical and structured resource to prepare for the baccalaureate practical exams. Each practice test is carefully documented and organized, making it easy to navigate and find specific subjects. Answer keys are included to help students understand and consolidate their knowledge of NSI.

Whether you are an NSI student, teacher, or simply interested in the field, "NSI Practical Exams" is a valuable tool to study, practice, and deepen your skills in Python programming and problem solving related to NSI.
